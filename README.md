# Research-Papers
This is the repository where I have stored a lot of my Research Papers I have completed.

I currently have completed two papers. The first is on the Eternal Blue Exploit that occured many years ago. The second is on Linear Quadratic Optimization in Continuous Time with regards to Reinforcement Learning.
